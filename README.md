# FaceSwap
This is the code behind the Switching Eds blog post:      http://matthewearl.github.io/2015/07/28/switching-eds-with-python/  See the above for an explanation of the code below.  To run the script you'll need to install dlib (http://dlib.net) including its Python bindings, and OpenCV. You'll also need to obtain the trained model from sourceforge:      http://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2  Unzip with `bunzip2` and change `PREDICTOR_PATH` to refer to this file. The script is run like so:      ./faceswap.py &lt;head image> &lt;face image>  If successful, a file `output.jpg` will be produced with the facial features from `&lt;head image>` replaced with the facial features from `&lt;face image>`.
